To format the documentation for Google Docs, follow these steps to ensure clarity and readability:

1. **Title and Introduction:**
   - Start with a clear title: "GitHub API Integration Documentation".
   - Introduce the purpose of the document briefly.

2. **Endpoint Documentation:**
   - For each endpoint (e.g., Compare Commits, List Commits), use a structured format:
     - **Endpoint:** Describe the endpoint URL.
     - **Method:** Specify the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
     - **Description:** Explain what the endpoint does.
     - **Parameters:** List and describe each parameter.
     - **Example Request:** Provide a sample request URL.
     - **Example Response (JSON):** Show a sample response for clarity.
     - **Status Codes:** List the possible HTTP status codes and their meanings.

3. **Authentication and Error Handling:**
   - Document how authentication works (e.g., OAuth).
   - Explain how errors are handled (e.g., 404 Not Found, 422 Unprocessable Entity).

4. **Formatting Tips for Google Docs:**
   - Use headings (e.g., Heading 1 for main sections, Heading 2 for subsections).
   - Bullet points for lists of parameters, status codes, etc.
   - Use tables for clear presentation of parameters and examples.
   - Include hyperlinks for URLs and references to GitHub's API documentation.

5. **Additional Considerations:**
   - Mention rate limiting considerations.
   - Notes on caching strategies or pagination where applicable.

6. **Review and Share:**
   - Proofread the document for clarity and completeness.
   - Share the Google Docs link with collaborators or stakeholders.

- **422 Unprocessable Entity:**

---

**Rate Limiting**

GitHub's API has rate limits based on authentication (unauthenticated requests are limited to 60 per hour, authenticated requests vary by scope).

---

**Notes**

- Ensure proper error handling for all endpoints to gracefully manage GitHub API responses and application-specific errors.
- Use appropriate caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce API rate limits usage.
- Consider pagination for endpoints that return large datasets (e.g., commits).

This structured format will help organize the documentation clearly in Google Docs, making it easier to read and reference for developers and stakeholders. Adjust the content and formatting according to your specific application needs and GitHub API usage.
